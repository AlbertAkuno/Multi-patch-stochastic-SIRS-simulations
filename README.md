# Stochastic-multi-patch-SIRS-simulations
This repository contains codes for numerical simulation and computation of expected time to disease extinction of a multi-patch stochastic SIRS epidemic model. The codes are used to generate results for Chapter 6 of my PhD thesis **_Inference on Deterministic and Stochastic Epidemic Models with Mobility_**
